# Architectural Decision Record for Developing a Mobile App for a Retail Company

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The purpose of this ADR is to review the existing requirements for developing a mobile app for a retail company; to provide architectural decisions on varies technical aspects which include the app type, UI framework, backend language, payment gateway, data storage, app permissions and data collections.

## Decision

After analysis, the following are the proposed architectural decisions for the retail app:

- App Type: Hybrid
  It is proposed to develop a hybrid app for the retail company. The reason is a hybrid app could run on varies operation systems and devices, include laptops, tablets, and mobile phones, on both online and offline mode, which would help the retail app to expand the customer base and user types.
- UI Framework: React Native
  It is suggested to use React Native as the UI framework because the libraries of React Native are compatible and reusable for cross-platform devices (such as iOS and Android), which could save development time for building the hybrid app. Besides, the React Native components are capable to load and show particular images on the app screen, either from local or remote sources, which could help the retail app to display product images with optimize performances.
- Backend Language: Express/Node.js
  The reason for choosing Express/Node.js as backend language is it is highly compatible with React Native, which could save development time. Another reason is, React Native could make HTTP requests to server through Node.js APIs. This could enable the retail app to synchronize customer data, handle concurrent requests and integrate with push notifications.
- Payment Gateway: PayPal
  PayPal is a secure payment gateway which support end-to-end encryption to protect customer financial and personal data. PayPal is also a popular payment gateway which is commonly used in over 200 countries and supports over 100 currencies. Therefore, it is a good choice for the retail app to handle orders and transactions for international customer.
- Data Storage - MongoDB
  MongoDB as database platform which could be seamlessly execute with React Native and Node.js. Besides, MongoDB could handle massive data and with build-in tool to generate visualize dashboard. Its Realm Sync feature could support both offline data sync or online cloud storage, which matches the app requirements.
- Permissions:
  The following are permissions require to use the retail app:
  1. Location - enable the app to show different language and cultural preferences according to user's location.
  2. Notification - enable the app to push notification to customer about new products and special offers.
  3. SMS - enable the app to send SMS to customer about order and delivery status.
- Data Collection:
  The following user data would be collected by the retail app:
  1. App Activity - the customer browsing history, order history and app interactions data would be collected by the retail app for data analysis, marketing, and personalization purposes.
  2. App Info and Performance - any crash logs, diagnostics and performance data would be collected for improving the app performance and user experiences.
  3. Personal Info - the customerâ€™s name, email account, phone number and address would be collected for sending notification about order delivery.
  4. Financial Info - the customer purchase and transaction data would be collected for personalization and marketing purposes.

## Consequences

Based on above proposed architectural decisions, we believe the use of M.E.R.N. stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), PayPal, and with the predefined data collection and user permission policies would help to develop a scalable and robust mobile app for the retail company. The app would support both online and offline mode, enable push notifications, integrate with secure payment method, capable to track user behavior, with optimize performance, and be expandable and scalable to international customer base.
